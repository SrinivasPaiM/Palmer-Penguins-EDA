# Penguin Data Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the penguin dataset to uncover insights about penguin species, their physical characteristics, behaviors, and ecological patterns across different islands.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and removes unnecessary columns.
- **Visualization**: Provides detailed visualizations for species distribution, physical features, and clutch completion rates.
- **Isotopic Analysis**: Highlights the unique isotopic composition of Gentoo penguins.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines relationships between numerical features.

## Steps
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load and clean the dataset.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Visualize species distribution and physical features.
5. Analyze clutch completion rates and isotopic composition.
6. Save and reload the cleaned dataset for future use.

## Requirements
Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is `penguins_lter.csv`. Ensure the file is in the same directory as the notebook.

## Outputs
- Cleaned dataset: `penguins_lter_clean.csv`
- Visualizations: Various plots generated during the analysis.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into penguin species, emphasizing the ecological adaptability and superiority of Gentoo penguins based on physical and isotopic characteristics.
